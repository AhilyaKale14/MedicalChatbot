      "Chatbot: Anxiety is a normal and often adaptive reaction to stress or potential danger. It is a feeling of unease, such as worry or fear, that can be accompanied by physical symptoms such as increased heart rate, sweating, and restlessness. Anxiety becomes a problem when it is excessive, persistent, and interferes with daily activities and functioning. It can be categorized into different types, including generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and specific phobias. Treatment for anxiety may include therapy, medications, lifestyle modifications, and stress management techniques.\n",

      "\n",
      "4) Sleep disturbances: Difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or experiencing restless and unrefreshing sleep.\n",

      "\n",
      "It's important to note that experiencing one or more of these symptoms doesn't necessarily mean you have an anxiety disorder.
